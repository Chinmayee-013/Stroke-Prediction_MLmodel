"Stroke Prediction Project
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of stroke using data science techniques. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability globally, 
and early prediction can lead to timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis, this project seeks to create a reliable and 
accurate modelthat healthcare providers can use to assess stroke risk."
